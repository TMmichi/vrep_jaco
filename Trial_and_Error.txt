1. No kinematics plugins defined. Fill and load kinematics.yaml!
    
    A. kinematics.yaml file -> chk kinematics name if it matches with the planning group


2. Group '[]' was not found.

    A. move_group(PLANNING_GROUP_) error. TBU -> SRDF???


3. move_group.getCurrentState() not receiving current state of the joint,
   with error msg: Failed to fetch current robot state

    A. most probably joint_states msg has not been received by move_group.
       chk if your robot/joint_states are properly remaped from joint_states in every scope of ROS launch file

       TIP.
       The following command should be included BOTH inside the move_group node and out.
       <remap from="joint_states" to="robot/joint_states"/>


4. Robot model parameter not found! Did you remap 'robot_description'?

    A. param: robot_description NOT SET-> command with xacro import needed
